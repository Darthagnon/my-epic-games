Repo for tracking my Epic Games collection over time via Git


[Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/releases) is a FOSS tool that can list your owned games on the Epic store. I play very few of them, even though I claim all free ones, because I don't like dealing with the hassle of DRM and launchers. I don't trust any company (Valve's Steam, Epic, CD Projekt's GOG, Indiegala, Itch.io, etc.) to keep "my" licensed digital media perpetually available, so I thought it would be an interesting experiment to export periodic lists of my games, and see which disappear over time. Since I'm experimenting, Git seemed better than keeping date-stamped individual CSVs. 

## Usage
Place [print-csv-of-your-games.bat](/print-csv-of-your-games.bat) next to legendary.exe and run it to generate a CSV of your owned games on the Epic Games store.

My personal list is stored in this repo. Git commits contain date of CSV generation.
